# Introduction
Hey there, I'm Dip Podder! Two years ago, my journey began shaping narratives and exploring creativity as a content creator on YouTube and Facebook. Today, I'm embarking on a path fueled by a burgeoning passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, transitioning into a Python programmer.

With six months of immersive coding experience, I've honed my skills in Python and familiarized myself with tools like VS Code. My background in physics equips me with a robust understanding of algorithms and mathematics, serving as a strong foundation for my coding journey.

My true thrill lies in problem-solving and delving into the intricacies of the quantum world, complemented by occasional indulgences in adrenaline-pumping thrillers or heartwarming romance films.

Eager to contribute and learn in a professional environment, I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity with a dynamic startup or established company. I aim to learn from seasoned developers, make meaningful contributions to challenging projects, and further my growth as an AI & ML enthusiast.
